The Donation DAO

A. Overview-

DAO for no profit. Contribute funds to be distributed with no expectation to ROI, just for helping others.

Members pool funds together to be distributed upon proposals. 

Donating by 75% majority. Majority could be based on stake (more tokens more vote), or if identity is integrated could be done each member=1 vote.

B. Proof Flow 

1. Proposal of need uploaded - Could video be uploaded to the ether network? A formal letter for healthcare?  

2. Approval of need - Community as curators to decide if authentic? 

3. Proof of used (Oracles) - donating for example beds to hospitals, could be done through smart contract paying only for beds in Ikea and makes sure it's being sent to right address. Integration with api of relevant shops (could even assist in digital currencies adoption!). 

IoT integration - for example recycaling boxes with QR codes\NFC 

Use cases to explore - Food donation videos, Healthcare treatments, hospital beds, fullfiling a wish of kids with special needs

*Alternative model incentevizing doing good post donataion  - Get more than what you donated*

By proving a good deed smart contract will mint a coin that would be redeemed by % of the pooled funds. Community donation to the pool funds would determined good deed price. Could be integrated with crypto services, for example crypto exchanges constatly contributing 0.25% of revenues. Smart contract could be set to divide redemption if price is too high therefore incentivizes fraud.
