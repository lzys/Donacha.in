The Donation DAO

DAO for no profit. Contribute funds to be distributed with no expectation to ROI, just for the sake of helping & karma.

Members pool funds together to be distributed upon proposal. 

Donating by 75% majority. Majority could be based on stake (more tokens more vote), or if identity is integrated could be done each member=1 vote.

Adding donation proposals - should be added with proof of need in case of private donation, and proof of spent mechanism (to know how it was used).

Proof of need - Could be anything, like a letter from the bank, and identity approval.
Proof of used - donating for example beds to hospitals, could be done through smart contract paying only for beds in Ikea (or any relevant shop that accepts digital currencies - could even assist in adoption!).
